    "entry-content": "\nCzech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager, special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are sv\u011btl\u00e9 (pale), polotmav\u00e9 (amber), and tmav\u00e9 (dark). The gravity classes are v\u00fd\u010depn\u00ed (draft, 7\u201310 \u00b0P), le\u017e\u00e1k (lager, 11\u201312 \u00b0P), and speci\u00e1ln\u00ed (special, 13 \u00b0P+). Pivo is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings, particularly within the speci\u00e1ln\u00ed class. The style guidelines combine some of these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly found types for judging purposes.\nCzech lagers in general are differentiated from German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile, while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7\u201310 \u00b0C) and for a longer time, and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes Czech lagers.\n",
    "impression": "Overall ImpressionMalt-driven amber Czech lager with hop character that can vary from low to quite significant. The malt flavors can vary quite a bit, leading to different interpretations ranging from drier, bready, and slightly biscuity to sweeter and somewhat caramelly.\n",
    "appearance": "AppearanceDeep amber to copper color. Clear to bright clarity. Large, off-white, persistent head.\n",
    "aroma": "AromaModerate intensity, rich malt aroma that can be either bready and Maillard product-dominant or slightly caramelly and candy-like. Spicy, floral or herbal hop character may be moderate to none. Clean lager character, though low fruity esters (stone fruit or berries) may be present. Diacetyl is optional and can range from low to none.\n",
    "flavor": "FlavorComplex malt flavor is dominant (medium to medium-high), though its nature may vary from dry and Maillard product-dominant to caramelly and almost sweet. Some examples have a candy-like to graham-cracker malt character. Low to moderate spicy hop flavor. Prominent but clean hop bitterness provides a balanced finish. Subtle plum or berry esters optional. Low diacetyl optional. No roasted malt flavor. Finish may vary from dry and hoppy to relatively sweet.\n",
    "mouthfeel": "MouthfeelMedium-full to medium body. Soft and round, often with a gentle creaminess. Moderate to low carbonation.\n",
    "comments": "CommentsThe Czech name of the style is polotmav\u00e9 pivo, which translates as half dark. This style is a combination of the Czech styles polotmav\u00fd le\u017e\u00e1k (11\u201312.9 \u00b0P) and polotmav\u00e9 speci\u00e1ln\u00ed pivo (13\u201314.9 \u00b0P).\n",
    "comparison": "Style ComparisonThe style can be similar to a Vienna lager but with Saazer-type hop character, or that approaching an English bitter but significantly richer with more of a deep caramel character. Large brewery versions are generally similar to Czech Premium Pale Lager with slightly darker malt flavors and less hop, while smaller breweries often make versions with considerable hop character, malt complexity, or residual sweetness.\n",

    "ingredients": "Characteristic IngredientsPilsner and caramel malts, but Vienna and Munich malts may also be used. Low mineral content water, Saazer-type hops, Czech lager yeast.\n",
