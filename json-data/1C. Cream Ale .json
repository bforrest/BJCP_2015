    "entry-content": "\nThis category describes everyday American beers that have a wide public appeal. Containing both ales and lagers, the beers of this category are not typically complex, and have smooth, accessible flavors. The ales tend to have lager-like qualities, or are designed to appeal to mass-market lager drinkers as crossover beers. Mass-market beers with a more international appeal or origin are described in the International Lager category.\n",

    "comments": "CommentsPre-prohibition Cream Ales were slightly stronger, hoppier (including some dry hopping) and more bitter (25-30+ IBUs). These versions should be entered in the historical category. Most commercial examples are in the 1.050\u20131.053 OG range, and bitterness rarely rises above 20 IBUs.\n",
    "comparison": "Style ComparisonSimilar to a Standard American Lager, but with more character.\n",
