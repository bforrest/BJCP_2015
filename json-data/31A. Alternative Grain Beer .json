    "impression": "Overall ImpressionA base beer enhanced by or featuring the character of additional grain or grains. The specific character depends greatly on the character of the added grains.\n",
    "appearance": "AppearanceSame as base beer style, although some additional haze may be noticeable.\n",
    "aroma": "AromaSame as base beer style. The added grain will lend a particular character, although with some grains the beer will simply seem a bit more grainy or nutty. The alternative grain should provide the major aroma profile for this beer.\n",
    "flavor": "FlavorSame as base beer style. The additional grain should be noticeable in flavor, although it may not be necessarily identifiable. However, the alternative grain should provide the major flavor profile for this beer. Different grains have different characters; the additional grain should enhance the flavor of the base beer. Many will add an additional grainy, bready, or nutty flavor.\n",
    "mouthfeel": "MouthfeelSame as the base beer, although many additional grains will tend to increase the body (oats, rye) and increase the viscosity, while some may decrease the body (GF grains) resulting in thinness.\n",
    "comments": "CommentsIf the alternative grain does not provide a noticeable distinguishable character to the beer, enter it as the base style. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative grain is fundamental to the style definition (e.g., Rye IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Rice- or Corn-based International Lager). Note that sake is not beer, and is not intended for this category.\n",
