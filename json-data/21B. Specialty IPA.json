    "impression": "Overall ImpressionRecognizable as an IPA by balance \u2013 a hop-forward, bitter, dryish beer \u2013 with something else present to distinguish it from the standard categories. Should have good drinkability, regardless of the form. Excessive harshness and heaviness are typically faults, as are strong flavor clashes between the hops and the other specialty ingredients.\n",
    "appearance": "Color depends on specific type of Specialty IPA. Most should be clear, although certain styles with high amounts of starchy adjuncts, or unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy. Darker types can be opaque making clarity irrelevant. Good, persistent head stand with color dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA.",
    "aroma": "Detectable hop aroma is required; characterization of hops is dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA. Other aromatics may be present; hop aroma is typically the strongest element.",

    "entry-content": "\nThe IPA category is for modern American IPAs and their derivatives. This does not imply that English IPAs aren\u2019t proper IPAs or that there isn\u2019t a relationship between them. This is simply a method of grouping similar styles for competition purposes. English IPAs are grouped with other English-derived beers, and the stronger Double IPA is grouped with stronger American beers. The term \u201cIPA\u201d is intentionally not spelled out as \u201cIndia Pale Ale\u201d since none of these beers historically went to India, and many aren\u2019t pale. However, the term IPA has come to be a balance-defined style in modern craft beer.\n"
