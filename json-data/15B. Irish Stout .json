    "name": "15B. Irish Stout ",
    "category": "15. Irish Beer ",
    "entry-content": "\nThe traditional beers of Ireland contained in this category are amber to dark, top-fermented beers of moderate to slightly strong strength, and are often widely misunderstood due to differences in export versions, or overly focusing on the specific attributes of beer produced by high-volume, well-known breweries. Each of the styles in this grouping has a wider range than is commonly believed.\n",
    "impression": "Overall ImpressionA black beer with a pronounced roasted flavor, often similar to coffee. The balance can range from fairly even to quite bitter, with the more balanced versions having a little malty sweetness and the bitter versions being quite dry. Draught versions typically are creamy from a nitro pour, but bottled versions will not have this dispense-derived character. The roasted flavor can be dry and coffee-like to somewhat chocolaty.\n",
    "appearance": "AppearanceJet black to very deep brown with garnet highlights in color. According to Guinness, \u201cGuinness beer may appear black, but it is actually a very dark shade of ruby.\u201d Opaque. A thick, creamy, long-lasting, tan- to brown-colored head is characteristic when served on nitro, but don\u2019t expect the tight, creamy head on a bottled beer.\n",
    "aroma": "AromaModerate coffee-like aroma typically dominates; may have slight dark chocolate, cocoa and/or roasted grain secondary notes. Esters medium-low to none. Hop aroma low to none, may be lightly earthy or floral, but is typically absent.\n",
    "flavor": "FlavorModerate roasted grain or malt flavor with a medium to high hop bitterness. The finish can be dry and coffee-like to moderately balanced with a touch of caramel or malty sweetness. Typically has coffee-like flavors, but also may have a bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate character in the palate, lasting into the finish. Balancing factors may include some creaminess, medium-low to no fruitiness, and medium to no hop flavor (often earthy). The level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.\n",
    "mouthfeel": "MouthfeelMedium-light to medium-full body, with a somewhat creamy character (particularly when served with a nitro pour). Low to moderate carbonation. For the high hop bitterness and significant proportion of dark grains present, this beer is remarkably smooth. May have a light astringency from the roasted grains, although harshness is undesirable.\n",
    "comments": "CommentsWhen a brewery offered a stout and a porter, the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a \u201cStout Porter\u201d). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer necessarily reflect a higher strength than porters. This is typically a draught product today; bottled versions are typically brewed from a higher OG and are usually called Extra Stouts. Regional differences exist in Ireland, similar to variability in English Bitters. Dublin-type stouts use roasted barley, are more bitter, and are drier. Cork-type stouts are sweeter, less bitter, and have flavors from chocolate and specialty malts. Commercial examples of this style are almost always associated with a nitro pour. Do not expect traditional bottle-conditioned beers to have the full, creamy texture or very long-lasting head traditionally associated with nitrogen dispense.\n",
    "comparison": "Style ComparisonLower strength than an Irish Extra Stout, but with similar flavors. Darker in color (black) than an English porter (brown).\n",
    "history": "",
    "ingredients": "Characteristic IngredientsGuinness is made using roasted barley, flaked barley, and pale malt, but other breweries don\u2019t necessarily use roasted barley; they can use chocolate or other dark and specialty malts. Whatever combination of malts or grains is used, the resulting product should be black. Cork-type stouts are perhaps closer to historical London-type stouts in composition with a varied grist not dominated by roasted barley.\n",
