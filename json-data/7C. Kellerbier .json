    "comments": "CommentsYoung, unfiltered, unpasteurized versions of the traditional German beer styles, traditionally served on tap from the lagering vessel. The name literally means \u201ccellar beer\u201d \u2013 implying a beer served straight from the lagering cellar. Since this serving method can be applied to a wide range of beers, the style is somewhat hard to pin down. However, there are several common variants that can be described and used as templates for other versions. Sometimes described as Naturtr\u00fcb or naturally cloudy. Also sometimes called Zwickelbier, after the name of the tap used to sample from a lagering tank.\n",
