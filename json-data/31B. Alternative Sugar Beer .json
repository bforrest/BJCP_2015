    "entry-content": "\nThis category contains specialty beers that have some additional ingredient (grain or sugar) that adds a distinctive character.\n",
    "impression": "Overall ImpressionA harmonious marriage of sugar and beer, but still recognizable as a beer. The sugar character should both be evident but in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.\n",
    "appearance": "AppearanceSame as the base beer, although some sugars will bring additional colors.\n",
    "aroma": "AromaSame as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey, molasses, etc.) may add an aroma component. Whatever additional aroma component is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination.\n",
    "flavor": "FlavorSame as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey, molasses, etc.) may add a flavor component. Whatever additional flavor component is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some added sugars will have unfermentable elements that may provide a fuller finish; fully fermentable sugars may thin out the finish.\n",
    "mouthfeel": "MouthfeelSame as the base beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.\n",
    "comments": "CommentsIf the additional fermentables do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not have so much honey that it reads more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot) than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.\n",
