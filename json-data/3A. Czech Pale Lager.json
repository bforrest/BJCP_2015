    "impression": "Overall ImpressionA lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.\n",
    "appearance": "Light gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear, with a long-lasting, creamy white head.",
    "aroma": "Light to moderate bready-rich malt combined with light to moderate spicy or herbal hop bouquet; the balance between the malt and hops may vary. Faint hint of caramel is acceptable. Light (but never intrusive) diacetyl and light, fruity hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present. No sulfur.",
    "flavor": "Medium-low to medium bready-rich malt flavor with a rounded, hoppy finish. Low to medium-high spicy or herbal hop flavor. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. Flavorful and refreshing. Diacetyl or fruity esters are acceptable at low levels, but need not be present and should never be overbearing.",
    "mouthfeel": "Medium-light to medium body. Moderate carbonation.",
    "comments": "The Czech name of the style is sv\u011btl\u00e9 v\u00fd\u010depn\u00ed pivo.",
    "comparison": "A lighter-bodied, lower-intensity, refreshing, everyday version of Czech Premium Pale Lager.",
    "history": "Josef Groll initially brewed two types of beer in 1842\u20133, a v\u00fd\u010depn\u00ed and a le\u017e\u00e1k, with the smaller beer having twice the production; Evan Rail speculates that these were probably 10 \u00b0P and 12 \u00b0P beers, but that the v\u00fd\u010depn\u00ed could have been weaker. This is the most consumed type of beer in the Czech Republic at present.",
    "ingredients": "Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops, Czech Pilsner malt, Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates.",

    "entry-content": "\nCzech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager, special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are sv\u011btl\u00e9 (pale), polotmav\u00e9 (amber), and tmav\u00e9 (dark). The gravity classes are v\u00fd\u010depn\u00ed (draft, 7\u201310 \u00b0P), le\u017e\u00e1k (lager, 11\u201312 \u00b0P), and speci\u00e1ln\u00ed (special, 13 \u00b0P+). Pivo is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings, particularly within the speci\u00e1ln\u00ed class. The style guidelines combine some of these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly found types for judging purposes.\nCzech lagers in general are differentiated from German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile, while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7\u201310 \u00b0C) and for a longer time, and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes Czech lagers.\n"
