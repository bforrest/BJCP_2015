    "impression": "Overall ImpressionRich, characterful, pale Czech lager, with considerable malt and hop character and a long, rounded finish. Complex yet well-balanced and refreshing. The malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer, and the bitterness is strong but clean and without harshness, which gives a rounded impression that enhances drinkability.\n",
    "appearance": "Gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear clarity. Dense, long-lasting, creamy white head.",
    "aroma": "Medium to medium-high bready-rich malt and medium-low to medium-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop bouquet; though the balance between the malt and hops may vary, the interplay is rich and complex. Light diacetyl, or very low fruity hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.",
    "flavor": "FlavorRich, complex, bready maltiness combined with a pronounced yet soft and rounded bitterness and floral and spicy hop flavor. Malt and hop flavors are medium to medium-high, and the malt may contain a slight impression of caramel. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. The long finish can be balanced towards hops or malt but is never aggressively tilted either way. Light to moderate diacetyl and low hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.\n",
    "mouthfeel": "MouthfeelMedium body. Moderate to low carbonation.\n",
    "comments": "Generally a group of pivo Plze\u0148sk\u00e9ho typu, or Pilsner-type beers. This style is a combination of the Czech styles sv\u011btl\u00fd le\u017e\u00e1k (11\u201312.9 \u00b0P) and sv\u011btl\u00e9 speci\u00e1ln\u00ed pivo (13\u201314.9 \u00b0P). In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell is called a Pilsner, despite how widely adopted this name is worldwide. Kvasnicov\u00e9 (\u201cyeast beer\u201d) versions are popular in the Czech Republic, and may be either kr\u00e4usened with yeasted wort or given a fresh dose of pure yeast after fermentation. These beers are sometimes cloudy, with subtle yeastiness and enhanced hop character. Modern examples vary in their malt to hop balance and many are not as hop-forward as Pilsner Urquell.",
    "comparison": "Style ComparisonMore color, malt richness, and body than a German Pils, with a fuller finish and a cleaner, softer impression. Stronger than a Czech Pale Lager.\n",
    "history": "HistoryCommonly associated with Pilsner Urquell, which was first brewed in 1842 after construction of a new brewhouse by burghers dissatisfied with the standard of beer brewed in Plze\u0148. Bavarian brewer Josef Groll is credited with first brewing the beer.\n",
    "ingredients": "Characteristic IngredientsSoft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops, Czech malt, Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates. The bitterness level of some larger commercial examples has dropped in recent years, although not as much as in many contemporary German examples.\n",

    "entry-content": "\nCzech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager, special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are sv\u011btl\u00e9 (pale), polotmav\u00e9 (amber), and tmav\u00e9 (dark). The gravity classes are v\u00fd\u010depn\u00ed (draft, 7\u201310 \u00b0P), le\u017e\u00e1k (lager, 11\u201312 \u00b0P), and speci\u00e1ln\u00ed (special, 13 \u00b0P+). Pivo is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings, particularly within the speci\u00e1ln\u00ed class. The style guidelines combine some of these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly found types for judging purposes.\nCzech lagers in general are differentiated from German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile, while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7\u201310 \u00b0C) and for a longer time, and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes Czech lagers.\n"
